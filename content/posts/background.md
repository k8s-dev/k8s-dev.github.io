**Fun-fact:** I had tendered my resignation without a job at hand. Part of it was foolishness (*I am young at heart*) and part of it was confidence that *'all I want is a single job'* and with the skills I have, the certifications that I have earned (to prove my skill-sets) - it will be just fine and for sure I will land a job, after all Bengaluru is India’s silicon valley. Little did I know that I had to fight for a job in a pandemic situation. *grin*

To give a brief background, I have total of 12 years of work-exp and have spent 9+ years working at an Indian multinational IT service provider. During my stint there I was responsible for building solution’s around containers, Kubernetes and public clouds - GCP and AWS inclusive. I contributed towards modernising internal IPs and creating new offerings for Cloud Validation aspects, including in the space of chaos engineering.


I have decent experience across development, validation and automation around android, chrome os and linux systems. Most of my 9+ years of work at my previous job, I was deputed at customer’s locations both at Onsite, USA and at Bengaluru, IN, so I had customer facing experience too. I helped my clients in pre-production R&D efforts and made sure they were successful at their projects.


Life was great at my previous organisation. Having spent 9+ years with it, out of which 3+ years were in the USA, it had given me various avenues to grow and experiment and I feel my overall journey was satisfactory. Of late, due to personal reasons I decided to make a job switch. It was at the end of March 2020. Lockdown1.0 was in place due to Covid-19, I was working from home and had tendered my resignation, servicing official notice period. And without any new job offer in hand.


Waiting to figure what’s there in store!!
