Time flies. And in this short time - I completed my 2 months at AWS, and it is still #Day1. Needless to say - it has been a roller-coaster ride. I am part of Professional Services team here, and we provide assistance to our customers through a collection of offerings which helps achieve specific outcomes related to enterprise cloud adoption. It is a hands on job. I need to be working with clients to solve their difficult problems and help them use AWS services with ease. So far, I am loving the work. Team is awesome and everyone is more than happy to help in whichever way needed. Tons of resources in-house to go through, for everything there is a tool and to search those tools - another tool!

Joining AWS was a dream come true moment. The excitement which comes from being the part of _Earth's most customer centric organisation_ is real. Leadership principles are ingrained in all the decisions made day-to-day. Diversity of ideas is talked and worked on a lot. Work culture demonstrats the ownership and strong bias for action. I could not have asked for more!

On the learning front - I achieved my first AWS Certification - AWS Certified Solution Architect - Associate. I utilized Adrian Cantrill course at https://learn.cantrill.io The depth to which this course goes in - is admirable. Perfect kick-starter to provide the base to dive deeper in to AWS and related concepts. I highly recommend this course.

So - with this I can't anymore say that I work at AWS and do not have any AWS Cert :P

Meanwhile - we are actively hiring at AWS, there are multiple job openings, all listed at https://amazon.jobs. If you are game for it - I would be happy to provide referral, and if possible and time permits - provide guidance. Reach out to me via LinkedIn.
