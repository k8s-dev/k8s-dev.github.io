      <description>Fun-fact: I had tendered my resignation without a job at hand. Part of it was foolishness (I am young at heart) and part of it was confidence that &amp;lsquo;all I want is a single job&amp;rsquo; and with the skills I have, the certifications that I have earned (to prove my skill-sets) - it will be just fine and for sure I will land a job, after all Bengaluru is India’s silicon valley.</description>
