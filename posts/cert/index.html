				<p>Time flies. And in this short time - I completed my first quarter at AWS, and it is still #Day1. Needless to say - it has been a roller-coaster ride. I am part of Professional Services team here, and we provide assistance to our customers through a collection of offerings which helps achieve specific outcomes related to enterprise cloud adoption. It is a hands on job. I need to be working with Indian enterprise clients to solve their difficult problems and help them use AWS services with ease. My joining was non-ceremonious, pendemic made it worse. But my AWS team is awesome and everyone is more than happy to help in whichever way needed. Tons of resources in-house to go through, to say that it is an ocean is very much true. For everything there is a tool and to search those tools - another tool! Welcome to AWS :)</p>
<p>Joining AWS was a dream come true moment. The excitement which comes from being the part of <em>Earth&rsquo;s most customer centric organisation</em> is real. Leadership principles are ingrained in all the decisions made day-to-day. People surrounding you are super-smart and bring years of industry experience to the table. Diversity of ideas is talked and worked on a lot. Work culture demonstrats the ownership and strong bias for action. I get to work on complex problems and architect AWS native solutions for clients. It is like a big candy store - as a kid you would like to eat all of them and no one is there to stop you from doing that. I could not have asked for more!  :)</p>

<p>To help me get started I was assigned a 3 month long ramp up plan and a supportive mentor. I could shadow in multiple projects and learn various ways AWS does its business. On the learning front - I achieved my <strong>first</strong> AWS Certification - AWS Certified Solution Architect - Associate. I utilized <a href="https://learn.cantrill.io">Adrian Cantrill</a> course. The depth to which this course goes in - is admirable. Perfect kick-starter to provide the base to dive deeper into AWS and related concepts. I highly recommend this course. Couple it with <a href="https://tutorialsdojo.com">Tutorialsdojo&rsquo;s</a> practice test and you should be good to go!</p>
<p>So - with this I can&rsquo;t anymore say that I work at AWS and do not have any AWS Cert :P</p>
<p>I am quite happy to note that my AWS interview experience has helped multiple folks to understand the interview process better and has helped them clear their AWS interviews. So many people have reached out to me via LinkedIn to express their gratitude. If you are one of them, my message to you is to <em>Pass it on</em>!</p>
<p>Meanwhile - we are actively hiring at AWS, there are multiple job openings, all listed at <a href="https://amazon.jobs">amazon&rsquo;s job site</a>. If you are are passionate about the cloud computing and are good at what you do - I would be happy to provide referral, and if time permits - provide guidance. Reach out to me via LinkedIn.
See you next time! Best Wishes :)</p>
